# 👋 Developer Onboarding

Welcome to the **Social Media Manager** developer documentation ecosystem by **ANM Labs**.

This page explains **how developers, partners, and technical reviewers can request access** to the **private Developer Documentation** and what that access includes.

---

## 🎯 Who Is Developer Documentation For?

Developer documentation access is intended for:

- Integration partners
- Technical consultants
- Platform evaluators
- Auditors and reviewers
- Approved external developers

The goal is to provide **architectural clarity and system understanding** without exposing proprietary implementation or source code.

---

## 🔐 What Developer Docs Include

Approved developers may receive **read-only access** to documentation covering:

- High-level system architecture
- AI system design (conceptual)
- Billing & tier models
- Authentication & security principles
- Deployment approach (high-level)
- Operational troubleshooting
- Product roadmap (technical view)

This access is **documentation-only**.

---

## ❌ What Is Not Shared

For clarity and transparency, the following are **never shared**:

- Application source code
- Internal business logic
- AI prompt implementations
- Production credentials or secrets
- Deployment scripts or pipelines

These boundaries are intentional and non-negotiable.

---

## 🧭 Why Access Is Restricted

Social Media Manager is a **commercial, production SaaS platform**.

Restricting developer documentation ensures:
- Protection of intellectual property
- Platform security
- Responsible collaboration
- Clear separation between **understanding** and **implementation**

This is a standard practice for modern SaaS products.
